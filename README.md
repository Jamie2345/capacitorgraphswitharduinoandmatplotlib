In the main.py script I have included the line of code useFixedSizeGraph = True. This can be set to toggle between modes where the graph has a set sample size of data it displays and a mode where it shows all data recorded.

useFixedSizeGraph = True

useFixedSizeGraph = False

The data shown on the graph is animated and in real time using matplotlibs FuncAnimation() function.
